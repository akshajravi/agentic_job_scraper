# Job Application Bot - Playwright Project

## Project Overview
Automated job application bot that scrapes GitHub repos for job postings and applies via Playwright to LinkedIn, Greenhouse, and Lever platforms.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.9+
- Playwright (browser automation)
- SQLite (application tracking)
- Requests (GitHub API/scraping)

## Key Principles
1. Use Playwright's auto-waiting - don't add manual sleeps unless necessary
2. Use locators over selectors when possible (more resilient)
3. Add anti-detection measures (random delays, human-like behavior)
4. Robust error handling with screenshots on failures
5. Always check database before applying to avoid duplicates

## Code Patterns

### Playwright Setup
Use headless=False during development. Add args to avoid automation detection.

### Element Interaction Pattern
Prefer get_by_role and get_by_label over CSS selectors. Use wait_for_selector for dynamic content.

### Error Handling Pattern
Wrap interactions in try/except blocks. Take screenshots on failures. Log errors with job_id.

## File Structure
- scrapers/github_scraper.py - Fetch jobs from GitHub
- handlers/linkedin_handler.py - LinkedIn Easy Apply logic
- handlers/greenhouse_handler.py - Greenhouse application logic
- handlers/lever_handler.py - Lever application logic
- database/tracker.py - SQLite application tracking
- utils/filters.py - Job filtering logic
- utils/anti_detection.py - Human-like behavior utilities
- main.py - Orchestrator loop

## Important Notes
- Never submit applications during testing - use a flag: dry_run=True
- Store credentials in .env file, never hardcode
- Log every action to help debugging
- Take screenshots on errors
- Rate limit to 50-100 applications per day
- Check for platform-specific rate limits

## Testing Guidelines
- Test each handler on 3-5 jobs before automating
- Verify database logging works correctly
- Check anti-detection measures (delays, mouse movements)
- Monitor for CAPTCHA triggers

## Common Playwright Commands
- page.goto(url) - Navigate
- page.get_by_role(role, name=...) - Find by accessibility
- page.get_by_label(text) - Find by label
- page.get_by_text(text) - Find by text content
- page.locator(selector) - CSS/XPath selector
- page.wait_for_load_state("networkidle") - Wait for page load
- page.screenshot(path=...) - Debug screenshot
