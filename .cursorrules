# Job Application Bot - Cursor Rules

## Context
This is a Playwright-based job application automation bot. Help me understand and debug code related to web scraping and form automation.

## Code Style
- Use type hints for all functions
- Add docstrings to all functions explaining purpose, params, and return values
- Use descriptive variable names (no single letters except loop counters)
- Keep functions under 50 lines - break into smaller functions if needed

## When Explaining Code
1. Start with the high-level purpose of the function/file
2. Explain the logical flow step-by-step
3. Highlight any tricky parts or gotchas
4. Mention what could go wrong and how it's handled
5. Suggest improvements if you see any

## Playwright-Specific Guidance
- Explain why we use locators vs selectors
- Point out when manual waits are unnecessary (Playwright auto-waits)
- Suggest more resilient selector strategies when you see fragile ones
- Warn about actions that might trigger anti-bot detection

## Error Debugging
When I share an error:
1. Explain what the error means in plain English
2. Identify the most likely cause
3. Show me exactly which line(s) to change
4. Explain WHY that fix works
5. Suggest how to prevent similar errors

## Code Review Focus Areas
- Are selectors fragile? (suggest more robust alternatives)
- Missing error handling?
- Hardcoded values that should be config?
- Unnecessary sleeps/waits?
- Not checking if already applied?
- Missing logs for debugging?
- Database queries that could fail?
- Credential management issues?

## Preferences
- Explain technical concepts in simple terms
- Show code examples when explaining solutions
- Prioritize maintainability and reliability over cleverness
- Point out potential breaking changes when LinkedIn/Greenhouse/Lever update their sites
